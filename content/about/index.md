           <p class="pt-4">Hi my name's Shaun Foulkes (very average golfer), I'm currently working as a brewer at Theakstons.Ltd but also undertaking a web development course on a night taught by the Coders Guild. I want to become front-end developer in the near future. I began coding in my free time at the start of 2023 slowly building a portfolio of work and now currently learning Javascript. </p>
